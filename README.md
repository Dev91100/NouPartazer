## The problem identified
Food wastage is quite an overlooked problem in the general society. It is present in every country including ours which is Mauritius. The sad reality is that it will always be present. However, it is possible to reduce it to a minimum. This can greatly help to achieve one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals including 'Zero Hunger' and 'No Poverty' which are our main targets.
