## Problem identified
The causes of hunger and malnutrition include **poverty, inequalities** and **natural disasters**. Unfortunately, Mauritius has been experiencing all of these in 2020. Although severe poverty is rare in Mauritius compared to other parts of Africa, the country contains a minority of very **poor households**, most of which are located in rural areas. The current global pandemic has had a strong negative impact on food supply chains worldwide by simultaneously affecting farm production, food processing, transport and logistics as well as final demand. This, combined with supermarkets closing for several weeks, has **increased the levels of poverty and hunger** in Mauritius.

Some NGOs in Mauritius combat these social plagues by distributing food accross the island. However, their only platforms are online through a website which limits their visibility and accessibilty from those who want to donate and participate in this combat. Nowadays smartphones are more accessible than computers and an app well designed is more user friendly and intuitive than a website. Our solution can greatly help to achieve one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals including **'Zero Hunger'** and **'No Poverty'** which are our main targets.

## About our app
**NouPartazer(WeShare)** is a food sharing app which aims at reducing the problem of hunger in Mauritius. The mobile application will facilitate the process of food collect between three main stakeholders: **NGOs, Businesses** and **Individuals**.

**Our objectives are as follows:**
- To create a user friendly platform for its users.
- To reduce food wastage and provide to vulnerable families.
- To promote food collection events from NGOs.
- To make NGOs aware of donations from businesses.
