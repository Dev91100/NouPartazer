## Problem identified
The causes of hunger and malnutrition include **poverty, inequalities** and **natural disasters**. Unfortunately, Mauritius has been experiencing all 3 of these in 2020. Although severe poverty is rare in Mauritius compared to other parts of Africa, the country contains a minority of very **poor households**, most of which are located in rural areas. The current global pandemic has had a strong negative impact on food supply chains worldwide by simultaneously affecting farm production, food processing, transport and logistics as well as final demand. This, combined with supermarkets closing for several weeks, has **increased the levels of poverty and hunger** in Mauritius.

Some NGOs in Mauritius combat these social plagues by distributing food accross the island. However, their only platforms are online through a website which limits their visibility and accessibilty from those who want to donate and participate in this combat. Nowadays smartphones are more accessible than computers and an app well designed is more user friendly and intuitive than a website. Our solution can greatly help to achieve one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals including **'Zero Hunger'** and **'No Poverty'** which are our main targets.

## Solution proposed
**NouPartazer(WeShare)** is a food sharing app which aims at reducing the problem of hunger in Mauritius. The mobile application will facilitate the process of food collect between three main stakeholders: **NGOs, Businesses** and **Individuals**.

**Our objectives are as follows:**
- To create a user friendly platform for its users.
- To reduce food wastage and provide to vulnerable families.
- To promote food collection events from NGOs.
- To make NGOs aware of donations from businesses.

### How to use the app?
#### Use case #1 - Restaurant food surplus
A restaurant can have surplus of food every week that are thrown away. Instead of wasting the food, the owner of the restaurant can create an account in NouPartazer(WeShare) and post a donation event with details such as food type, which in this case is perishable food, a date and time when an NGO can come and collect the food and more details about the location of the restaurant.<br>

This donation will be visible to all NGOs which are registered in the app. An NGO which is interested and able to handle perishable food can accept this donation and get prepared to go and collect the food so that it can be redistributed to people in need.
