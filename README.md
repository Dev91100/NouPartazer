## **Problem identified**
The causes of hunger and malnutrition include **poverty, inequalities** and **natural disasters**. Unfortunately, Mauritius has been experiencing all 3 of these in 2020. Although severe poverty is rare in Mauritius compared to other parts of Africa, the country contains a minority of very **poor households**, most of which are located in rural areas. The current global pandemic has had a strong negative impact on food supply chains worldwide by simultaneously affecting farm production, food processing, transport and logistics as well as final demand. This, combined with supermarkets closing for several weeks, has **increased the levels of poverty and hunger** in Mauritius.

Some NGOs in Mauritius combat these social plagues by distributing food accross the island. However, their only platforms are online through a website which limits their visibility and accessibilty from those who want to donate and participate in this combat. Nowadays smartphones are more accessible than computers and an app well designed is more user friendly and intuitive than a website. Our solution can greatly help to achieve one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals including **'Zero Hunger'** and **'No Poverty'** which are our main targets.<br><br>

## **Solution proposed**
**NouPartazer(WeShare)** is a food sharing app which aims at reducing the problem of hunger in Mauritius. The mobile application will facilitate the process of food collection between three main stakeholders: **NGOs, Businesses** and **Individuals**.

**Our objectives are as follows:**
- To create a user friendly platform for its users.
- To reduce food wastage and provide to vulnerable families.
- To promote food collection events from NGOs.
- To make NGOs aware of donations from businesses.<br><br>

### **Use cases**
- #### Use case #1 - Restaurant food surplus
A typical restaurant has surplus of food every week that are thrown away. Instead of wasting the food, the owner of the restaurant creates an account in NouPartazer(WeShare) and posts a donation event with details such as food type, *which in this case is perishable food*, a date and time when an NGO can come and collect the food and more details about the location of the restaurant.<br>

This donation will be visible to all NGOs which are registered in the app. An NGO which is interested and able to handle perishable food can accept this donation and get prepared to go and collect the food so that it can be redistributed to people in need.

Using the task page, both the restaurant and NGO can keep track of the donation status and with the QR Code scanning process, the business can both confirm the identity of the NGO which is collecting the food and confirm the food donation process.

- #### Use case #2 - NGOs visibility and accessibility
A business or an individual who wants to donate to a particular NGO can scroll through the list of registered NGOs and get easy access to their information such as contact details, email and website. The app promotes the visibility of NGOs thus increasing the amount of donations and/or sponsors they obtain.

- #### Use case #3 - Wedding food surplus
During wedding season, there is a relatively high number of marriage ceremonies being carried out in our small country of Mauritius. These ceremonies typically have hundreds of guests and can last a few days.

There is a high probability of food surpluses that are wasted during these events. The organisers usually try to redistribute some of the surpluses to guests and relatives. Despite of this, there is still a huge amount of left over food including various ingredients such as vegetables and meat. Those ingredients are sometimes 1 month away from expiry because it was obtained at a cheaper rate in order to reduce the cost of the wedding.

Using NouPartazer, the organisers can create a donation event so that the food wastage is greatly reduced and instead the food will reach the mouths of the needier people through NGOs.

- #### Use case #4 - NGO promote food collection event
Through the creation of stories within the app, an NGO can promote its food collection events. Both individuals and businesses can view these stories thus attracting more people to contribute.
